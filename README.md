## Introduction

In the 18th century, the first bank was created which is the Bank of England.  However, the roots of modern banking can be traced back to the 1960s, when banks began to use computers to automate their processes 2. This led to the development of new financial products and services, such as credit cards and ATMs. In the first quarter of 2022, banks made a profit of $59.7 billion, which is a 22.2% decrease from the first quarter of 2021 1. Nearly 70% of bank profits come from the difference between the interest they earn and what they pay out to customers. Effective risk management and informed investment decisions are essential for success in this dynamic market.
